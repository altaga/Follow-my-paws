If you have a dog, cat or any pet that needs to go into a kennel when travelling and be left in the hands of parcel services, you know how stressfull and problematic it is for your precious friends. The main problem thus is: The horrid care pets get when they are transported in parcel services. Sometimes we need to send pets with parcel services. How can we be sure they're fine at all times? Take into consideration how baggage is treated.

Always use technology to improve the world, if you are a black hat or gray hat hacker please abstain at this point ......... or at least leave your star to make me feel less guilty XP.

## Introduction:

The horrid care pets get when they are transported in parcel services. Sometimes we need to send pets with parcel services. How can we be sure they're fine at all times? Take into consideration how baggage is treated.

I will make an integral IoT solution to monitor the petâ€™s environment, in order to ensure their well-being throughout their journey, all this also integrated with a cloud platform which, in addition to showing me the status of the package in real time, also sends notifications at the frequency that is convenient. 

The current monitoring solutions are restricted to only lifeless packages, this making the continuous monitoring of pets a novelty. It is useful because thanks to this system pet owners can be 100% sure that their pets will be well and can monitor and follow them throughout their journey.

## Materials:

Hardware: 

- WIO Lte. 
- Soracom Air Global IoT SIM Card.
- DTH11 (Preferably the Grove version).

- Grove - 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer.

Software: 

- Arduino IDE. 
- AWS Cloud Services.
- Soracom Platform.

## Hardware Hacking:

To connect the sensors to the WIO, it is necessary that the sensors have a Grove-type input, such as those shown in the following link.

For this project, i buy the "Grove Starter Kit Plus" package which is shown in the following images.

Las conexiones que se realizaron fueron las siguientes.

El acelerometro Grove no tuvo problema en conectarse a la WIO debido a que este ya cuenta con su entrada Grove, el que se tuvo que hackear fue el DHT, ya que no tenia el DHT version Grove.

Accelerometer Grove Version:

This is how i connect the module to the grove cable:
